# Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)

This project uses unsupervised machine learning to predict clusters in the iris dataset. The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook and uses libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to perform data analysis and visualization. The goal of the project is to train a machine learning model to predict clusters in the iris dataset. The model is trained using a k-means clustering algorithm.

## Getting Started

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook to perform prediction using unsupervised machine learning. The code imports necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. It reads data from the iris dataset and performs exploratory data analysis and data visualization.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Installing
